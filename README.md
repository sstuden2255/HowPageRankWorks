# How PageRank Works

Team members:
* Simon Studen

This is an interactive article that describes how the PageRank algorithm works. This was a group project for my data visualization class that I worked on with one other student. My role was primarily doing the frontend work for the website, which included designing and implementing the overall layout, writing the descriptions, and implementing the static visualizations. To create the website, I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS and deployed it via GitHub Pages.
